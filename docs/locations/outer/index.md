As happens with all thriving settlements, Haven's expanding population has outgrown the walls built by the town's early settlers.  While the farmlands have stretched to the east and north, newer settlers unable to find lodging within the town's walls have made the area to the south of the city their home.  As the rate of immigration has increased of late, the so-called Outer City has even crossed to the southern bank of the River Po.

The name Outer City is somewhat of a joke, given that Haven in its entirety at the present time is nowhere near the size that anyone would refer to it as a city.  However, the proud residents of the Outer City took on the name as a reminder to the "inside folks" that those living outside the walls would eventually outnumber those inside.  Their concerns should be taken seriously, even if the average Outer City resident may not be as well off as those inside the walls.

With the stone and timber required to build sturdy, large buildings in increasingly short supply as the nearby forests and quarries are emptied, construction in the Outer City is less consistent, more ramshackle, and might leave something to be desired for those used to the finer things.  However, creativity and a practical spirit often make for vibrant, interesting edifices.  The streets and alleys in the Outer City tend to be narrower and less well-defined than those inside the walls.  In fact, what was a street one day could disappear the next!  It's useful to find a reliable guide when looking for anything or anyone in the Outer City, despite its modest size.

The [Town Guard](../officials/guardhouse) have been spending more time in the Outer City lately, working hard to keep up with matters both criminal and civil.  Given that they administer social services alongside a healthy dose of justice, their presence is accepted for the most part.

## Residents

### Mushika

Mushika is an unusual character, typically clothed in a shabby gray cloak that conceals his features.  He will gladly plead with others that he is down on his luck and having a hard time fitting in, which seems to be true.  His penchant for petty thievery probably does not endear him to others, but his cowardice makes him a sympathetic figure.  His overall demeanour could be described as jittery.

Now that he's back in town and been given a second chance, Mushika has taken up a role as an informant for the [Town Guard](../officials/guardhouse) in the Outer City.  Mushika means well and works hard, but he still has a lot to learn.  Asimi, in her teaching guise of Ophelia the Swindler, offered Mushika a few tests, but he couldn't quite navigate them all.  Keep at it, ol' boy!

### Radella

Someone has to play the role of the Outer City's top-ranked street urchin and Radella has settled into the role nicely.  A true scamp, you'll most likely get acquainted when you find her hand in your coin pouch.  She's smart enough to conduct this chicanery only in the Outer City and rarely enters the city proper.  No one is sure where she came from or how old she is, as her stories vary considerably between tellings.  Her appearance is unusual, with large, brown eyes and sharply pointed ears that poke out from a truly wild mane of auburn hair.  Radella's clothing is a mix of whatever items she's recently taken a fancy to and "acquired".

In spite of the difficulties in keeping Radella separated from your possessions, she has a reputation as a useful source of information in the Outer City, which is worth its weight in however much gold she manages to steal from you.  Our heroes recently found that if that information is in the form of directions through the shifting labyrinth of the Outer City, they will likely be prefaced by something ridiculous, so stay on your toes.

Asimi, operating as Ophelia the Swindler, has taken a shine to Radella, to the dismay of all those who wish to stay materially whole while wandering the Outer City.  mmudd was able to discern that even without Asimi's further teaching, Radella is an experienced practitioner of the street arts.

#### Andy, Bobby, and Jimmy

What's a street urchin queenpin without her gaggle of willing accomplices?  You know what they say, eight hands are better than two.  These three young lads travel the mazey streets of the Outer City with Radella, providing distractions and supplemental acquisitions.  They've put one over on mmudd, but Broxi was too primal for the children.  Their chief move is the sidekick cyclone, wherein they whirl about the victim such that the one doing the actual pickpocketing is near impossible to identify.  Unless you're Broxi.

### The Amberdune Pack

Odd, windowless house, one of the larger and more sturdy in the Outer City.  Door is currently in disrepair.  Seven of them, known to the party as jackalweres.  Operate [Amberdune Books](../marketplace/index#amberdune-books).  Previously of Baldur's Gate, led by Korvala.

### Alanah

Alanah is a hobgoblin woman selling watermelons.  From the latest report by the Town Guard, poor Alanah's cart broke down, but mmudd had no idea how to fix it.
