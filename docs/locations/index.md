## The Marketplace

The Marketplace has a wide and ever changing variety of colorful tents and stands acting as outlets for the more permanent and better stocked shops around Haven, as well as for the farmers to sell their wares.  At the center of the Marketplace is the Town Well, watched over by a statue of [Chauntea](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Chauntea), Toril's goddess of agriculture.  At the south end of the Marketplace is the Bulletin Board.  Residents post notices for everything from "Lost Cat" to "Room for Rent" to the obligatory "Adventurers Wanted".

## The Officials - 1

The cluster of buildings at the north of the interior of the wall is known as The Officials.  In addition to the venues listed below, this area also features blacksmiths, carpenters,two boarding houses, a temple, and a general store, among others.

* [Town Hall](officials/town_hall)
  * A brick and timber building adjacent to the Guardhouse, it houses the Mayor's Office and the Courtroom, and is used for City Council meetings.
* [The Exploration House](officials/exploration_house)
  * Charged with the planning and development of Haven, the Exploration House often hires adventurers to explore specific areas and investigate strange phenomenon.  They also buy maps, adventure journals, drawings, and artifacts brought back by adventurers.
* [The Guardhouse](officials/guardhouse)
  * Adjacent to the city wall, a large stone building of dwarven design with a tower that houses various facilities for the Town Guards.
* Irene's Lodging Facility
  * A boarding house operated by Irene De Ville, it offers rooms for rent.  Often a landing place for new arrivals while they get established in Haven.
* Town Meeting Room
  * A 40'x40' building at the north end of the Marketplace.  Used for public meetings, plays, talent shows, music recitals, etc., and can be reserved by any Haven resident for 50gp per day.  The sign-up sheet is in the Mayor's Office and reservations are subject to the Mayor's approval.

## The Burrows - 2

East of The Officials, this area of the city was constructed by the original gnomish settlers of Haven and predates even the city wall.  Given the size and tastes of the builders of this area, it isn't well-suited for purposes other than as gnomish homes.  However, don't let that dissuade you from paying a visit, as the residents of The Burrows are generally quite welcoming!

## The Crafts - 3

South of The Burrows is the area called The Crafts, which includes most of the blacksmiths, armourers, carpenters, masons, and the like.  There are fewer inns, boarding houses, and taverns here.  Be aware of the odd trash heap at the southern tip of The Crafts, as it is the home of Haven's only goblin resident, Crab, and while he seems to despise everyone and everything in existence, the residents of Haven are surprisingly protective of him.

## The Scholars - 4

## The Shopps - 5

*As told by Baern Hoffenhorn, shield dwarf priest of Dugmaren Brightmantle, self-appointed promoter of the Shopps:*
The largest cluster of buildings inside the walls of Haven is The Shopps.  Probably means it's the most important district, right?  (with a wink)  Don't let those stuffy folks in The Officials or all that noise from The Crafts fool you, the things you need the most are found in The Shopps!  Weavers, potters, dressmakers, bookbinders and the like.  When I speak to newcomers to Haven, the first question that always comes up is, "If they make things in The Crafts and they make things in The Shopps, then why do they need two places?"  Well, it's like this:  if the making of the things involves hammering, banging (such as done by my fellow dwarves!), shaking, bad smells, or explosions then it's done in the Crafts.  Everything else you can find in the Shopps.

Now there are some other lovely things to be found here.  For example, let me tell you about something that holds a special place in my heart.  Have you heard of the Temple of All Gods?  No?!  Oh, my good traveler, even those who worship the most obscure deities can find a place for prayer and contemplation in the Temple!  I've been working hard on behalf of the Wandering Tinker to provide a place of respite and solace for all who find their way to Haven, whether they were looking for Haven or not.  Perhaps we could exchange tales of the wondrous deeds of our respective deities the next time you stop in!

Finally, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention all of the fine boarding houses to be found in The Shopps, the most in any of the districts!  Cozy homes as well, as many of the families with children live here.  And while it's not a law, an agreement among neighbours means that none of the establishments here sell alcohol, encourage gambling, or offer any other adult entertainment.  Oh, is that a slight frown I see on your face?  No worries, my friend, there are wonderful places to relax and enjoy a hot meal and refreshing, albeit non-alcoholic, drink with friends.  I highly recommend the Arcade, where they have games of skill or chance (just friendly games, no gambling), or the Stumbalon Inn, with songs and stories from the finest bards in all of Haven and any plane that happens to intersect with our lovely home!

## The Shadows - 6

Between The Shopps and The Officials is the district called The Shadows, which is not nearly as dark as one might think.  The name comes from an old halfling poem about two young people in love sneaking out for a kiss.  There are two very popular temples here, one to [Tymora](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Tymora), the goddess of good fortune, and one to [Lliira](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Lliira), the goddess of joy.  While both have chapels expressly for prayer and contemplation, most of the buildings are used for slightly different purposes.  The Temple of Tymora, for instance, is primarily a gambling hall.  The few boarding houses here are run down, cheap, and dangerous.  Most who rent rooms here do so from other businesses, especially taverns.  The safest and most well-known in the area is the Greasy Weasel Tavern.

* Greasy Weasel Tavern
* Temple of Tymora
* Temple of Lliira

## Outer City

A newer, less refined area of the city sits outside the southern city wall.  As Haven has outgrown its original footprint, residents have started constructing homes and storefronts, varying widely in materials and permanence.  The city officials have tried to assist in bringing a semblance of order to the Outer City, but thus far, the Outer City has resisted.  This isn't to say that chaos reigns or that it's the city's seedy underbelly, but if you're looking for that sort of thing, you might find it here.  Most folks are still helpful, confused about their rapid, unplanned migration to Haven, and just figuring things out.  Just like you!
