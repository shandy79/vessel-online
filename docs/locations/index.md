## The Marketplace

The Marketplace has a wide and ever changing variety of colorful tents and stands acting as outlets for the more permanent and better stocked shops around Haven, as well as for the farmers to sell their wares.  At the center of the Marketplace is the Town Well, watched over by a statue of [Chauntea](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Chauntea), Toril's goddess of agriculture.  At the south end of the Marketplace is the Bulletin Board.  Residents post notices for everything from "Lost Cat" to "Room for Rent" to the obligatory "Adventurers Wanted".

## The Burrows - 2

East of The Officials, this area of the city was constructed by the original gnomish settlers of Haven and predates even the city wall.  Given the size and tastes of the builders of this area, it isn't well-suited for purposes other than as gnomish homes.  However, don't let that dissuade you from paying a visit, as the residents of The Burrows are generally quite welcoming!
