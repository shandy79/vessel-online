Adjacent to the Guardhouse is the Exploration House.  Run mostly by the gnomes, the Exploration House is charged with the long-term exploration and development of Haven, including the eventual issuing of land grants.  The Exploration House is often the first and last stop for adventurers as the House will regularly pay to have particular areas explored and for well drawn maps, detailed travel journals, and artifacts.

## Staff

### Alston Garrick

Alston is a middle-aged, male rock gnome.  He seems to be in charge of the Exploration House, but as with any gnomish hierarchy, his hold on that position is tenuous at best.  Alston has a warm and disarming smile and is quick to laugh.  He is fascinated with every last item brought back from the wilds.  From an apparently worked ancient stone, to feathers from one of the varieties of local owlbear, he pores over these items almost constantly.

### Gimbol Timbers

Gimbol is a younger, male rock gnome.  More pensive and quiet than Alston, but no less friendly and helpful, Gimbol has many strange theories about Haven and is happy to share them with anyone who seems interested. Heâ€™s an excellent source of advice on properly outfitting for an Adventure.

### Patience

Patience, a female tiefling, is the lead administrator for the Exploration House.  While Alston and Gimbol steal the limelight chatting with adventurers, sending them on reconnaissance missions, and paying them for what they bring back, it is Patience who keeps everything running.  She is usually found directing the rest of the staff, balancing the books, and reining in the excitable gnomes when necessary.

### Scribble

Scribble is an older kenku, although exactly how old is difficult to say.  She is very friendly and serves as the scribe and notary for the Exploration House.  When she's not busy copying maps, journals, and drawings, she serves tea and cookies to visitors, 'plays' music, and whistles at handsome males of whatever species.

### Zensiro Qualanthri

A [Llewyrr](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Llewyrr) elf, of the city of Karador, capital of [Sarifal](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sarifal), which is once again situated on the island of Gwynneth in the Moonshae Isles.  Zensiro trained as a steward of the Feywild and explorer of the elemental planes following the return of Karador to Gwynneth by High Lady Ordalf.  With the emergence of Haven, Zensiro was dispatched by the High Lady to assist in the monitoring of planar travel.  Zensiro is currently the only person in Haven known to have been sent there directly by another being.  He keeps this information to himself, while constantly making inquiries of others regarding their experience "travelling" to Haven.

Zensiro is currently living out of his tent in the weirwood grove he discovered three hours southwest of town.  When it is necessary to stay in Haven proper, he prefers to spend the night in one of the Temple of All God's meditation rooms.
