The Guardhouse is a cluster of buildings of various styles, used by the Town Guard.  There are quarters for Captain Kolar as well as an office with a small reception area.  There are Barracks for the Guard with separate quarters for the officers.  The buildings of the Guardhouse surround on three sides an open area in the middle of the Officials that the Guard use as a parade ground.  This includes three horse stalls for the mounted Guard.   There is a Mess Hall, storage areas for food, water, weapons, equipment, potions, healing herbs, and whatever else Captain Kolar has up his sleeve.  There are currently 31 members of the Guard, including Captain Kolar, who is lobbying the Town Council to pay for more.

## Staff

### Captain Thoradan Kolar

Captain Kolar, a mountain dwarf, leads the Town Guard for the settlement of Haven.  An adventurer of great renown, when he heard about Haven he came to make it his permanent home.  His skin is on the pale side and freckled.  His hair is long, red, and streaked with white.  He is powerfully built, even for a dwarf. The captain is patient, approachable and good-natured.  His chief hobby is recreating antique weapons and armor in the style of the ancient dwarven clans.  As a result, he owns and is an expert in all manner of dwarven weapons and armor.  In town he wears the same style of light leather armor as the Town Guard, while in battle he wears dwarven plate armor that he made himself.

### Lieutenant Harri Valgyth

Lieutenant Vagyth is Kolar's second in command.  He prides himself on being reliable and true to his word.  A good deal over six foot tall, the lieutenant is generally cordial, but does not look like someone to be trifled with.

### Lieutenant Lotham Anaxapurna

Lotham originally hails from the Wyrmdoom Crag in the Spine of the World, home of the friendly Thuunlakalaga tribe of goliaths in Faerun.  After [Horatio Thorndown](./town_hall#mayor-horatio-thorndown), currently mayor of Haven, aided the tribe in driving off a marauding white dragon, Lotham felt honourbound to accompany Horatio and repay the debt he believed his tribe owed Horatio.  While departing his tribe nearly broke him, Horatio proved to be worthy of companionship as a man of tremendous courage and honour.  Over the years, they embarked on numerous adventures throughout Faerun, protecting those in need.  When Horatio retired to Limerock, he asked Lotham to join him and help to train the next generation of heroes.  Lotham reluctantly agreed, wishing to return to his tribe.  However, he grew very fond of Limerock, its quirky residents and other expert adventurers, and the young heroes that he guides.

Lotham, Horatio, and a strange githzerai monk named Bojovnik ended up in Haven after chasing a mischievous bariaur wanderer in the Snakewood and getting pulled into a portal opened by their quarry.  The whereabouts of the bariaur are currently unknown.

Lotham has a slightly nasal, higher-pitched voice than one might expect from a Goliath due to persistent allergies that occur while he is not in the lofty mountaintops in which his people typically reside.  However, few dare to mock him thanks to his imposing stature and mighty weapons.  Mayor Thorndown relies heavily on Lotham's judgement, occasionally to the irritation of Captain Kolar.

### Sergeant Robert Clintock

Frequently found at the northeast gate, Sergeant Clintock, or Bobby as he is usually called, is a down home, country sort of fellow.  He does his job, sure, but he doesn't mind a lengthy chat before dispensing with his duties.  It's unclear exactly from which world Bobby hails, but it's imagined that it is just as rough and tumble as Haven is.  That would explain why this particular human is such a good fit in what feels like a growing frontier town.
