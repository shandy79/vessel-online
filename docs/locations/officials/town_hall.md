If you've made your way to the Town Hall, you'd best hope it's not to defend yourself in the Courtroom, where [justice](../../general/laws_of_haven) is served out in a manner that is harsh, but fair.  Instead, aim to have a consultation with the good mayor or to sit in on a raucous session of the City Council.  Or avail yourself of the helpful people working there, hoping to make your life in Haven a little bit easier.

The Town Hall makes available numerous services for the people of Haven.  The stated goal of the current administration is that no one is left behind.  Most in Haven are not there of their own volition, so Mayor Thorndown has taken up the cause of providing a good start for all, regardless of their circumstances.  Services performed at Town Hall include, but are not limited to the following:

* Immigration
  * New arrivals are typically registered at the Town Hall for census and resource planning purposes.  Given that there is a relative dearth of precious metals in Haven, currency is also reported at registration.  No fees are collected, this is simply to have a sense of how much hard currency is circulating in the town, which helps in economic planning.
* Housing
  * Following registration, settlers are provided with a variety of housing options based on their financial means.  If one arrives with no coin or goods to barter, as is often the case, boarding house placements are made available for an exchange of services.
* Job Placement
  * While many new arrivals are adventurers, given that sort of folks' proclivity for getting into planar mischief, some settlers are better suited to more mundane work.  Others arrive with skills in the crafts and trades that are of great value to the community.  Job placement specialists see to it that, whatever your unique talent, you're able to put it to good use and earn a living.
* Tax Collection
  * All of these services don't come for free, so it is necessary for the Town Hall to collect a nominal tax on commercial transactions.  For those that simply labour and don't operate a business directly, this is generally not a consideration.  For business owners, or those that employ adventurers, directing payments to the Town Guard is just a part of life in Haven.
* Legal Services
  * Legal counsel can be provided upon request to those presenting cases to the Courtroom.  Good fortune has resulted in the appearance of three capable barristers in Haven, ensuring that all parties have effective and fair representation in legal matters.  The Laws of Haven are strictly enforced in the Courtroom through a combination of the disciplined Town Guard, the acting prosecutor, and the sitting judge.

## Staff

### Mayor Horatio Thorndown

Horatio, a human male well into middle age, is a soldier who had, in his younger years, been called many times to aid in the protection of a settlement in Faerun known as Limerock.  As he grew older and looked to settle down, Horatio realized that Limerock was a place where he could make a difference and keep his skills keen.  After a short time as a resident and with his history there, the townsfolk saw in Horatio the leader that they needed to safeguard their beloved settlement.  Alongside [Lotham Anaxapurna](./guardhouse#lieutenant-lotham-anaxapurna), a mighty goliath warrior pledged to his side, Horatio trained a new generation of adventurers and defenders of the settlement.

Unfortunately, Horatio and Lotham's time in Limerock was cut short after agreeing to aid a githzerai monk in tracking a very out of place bariaur wanderer.  While dashing through the Snakewood in pursuit of the being, it ensnared them all in a portal.  The three pursuers emerged in Haven, while the bariaur's whereabouts are unknown.  After establishing themselves in the town through a series of bold adventures, Horatio was yet again elected mayor and Lotham has worked his way up to the position of lieutenant in the Town Guard.

The mayor cuts a dashing figure, with a jet black mane and beard streaked with silver.  Horatio was fortunate to have entered the portal to Haven astride a valiant steed, Sunrise.  There are few horses in Haven, so Horatio's skill as a mounted combatant adds to his aura of prestige.  In addition to being fearless, Horatio has developed into an inspring leader who is always willing to join the fray.  He is particularly proud of the homegrown heroes that Haven now develops and will venture out to aid them when the situation looks dire.

### Liora Goldleaf

Liora is a surprisingly elderly elf who serves as the primary registrar for the Town Hall.  She handles any service listed above directly or will refer petitioners to the relevant authorities.  Wispy in form and attention, Liora is prone to drifting into her expansive memory and may trail off mid-sentence while speaking with townsfolk.  However, she has thus far been infallible in fulfilling her duties.  If she says your form will be forwarded to the Exploration House for coordinated registration as an adventurer, you can rest assured that exactly that will transpire.

### Stovall Excalius

A representative of the diversity of beings that have been pulled to Haven, Stovall is a not quite surly, not quite friendly centaur that found his career path in Town Hall.  He is an odd fit behind the registrar's desk, both physically and naturally.  Nearly as effective and far less wordy than Liora, Stovall often works the morning shift while Liora wanders the local forests.  When she returns, Stovall heads off to do his own strolling about in the wilderness.  The two of them are likely sources of information about peculiar things to be found out in those parts.
