Thia's Apothecary is a modest wood and plaster building in the middle of the Marketplace, run by the current proprietress, Rieta Brightwood.  An extensive herb garden flanks the three wooden steps up to the front door.  The interior walls are covered from floor to ceiling with shelves and cabinets, unbroken except for the front door, the door into the back and a counter, behind which is Rieta's desk.  There is a beaded curtain behind her.  In front of the counter is a ramp and platform for the smaller folk.  The room is filled with fragrant, growing herbs and flowers, and the shelves are lined with potions, remedies, and trinkets.  The shop is warm and inviting and gets a great deal of business, even late into the evening.  On the left side of the shop is a large, barred window where Rieta spends most of her time, concocting potions and chatting with the folks passing by.

## Proprietor

### Rieta Brightwood

Rieta has been a fixture at Thia's Apothecary since it opened in the summer of 1494 DR.  Everybody knows Rieta, though few can recall actually meeting Thia.  Rieta is in her early 20s, a tiefling, magenta in coloring with white hair, white eyes, cloven hooves and a tail.  She is very self-conscious about being a tiefling and is perhaps a bit standoffish because of some ill treatment she received in the past.  She is always formal, though polite.  She is very exacting and precise in nature (things you want in an apothecary).  She stands behind the quality of all of her potions and is very conscientious about her work.

Rieta is a great source of information.  She knows everyone and everyone's business.  She is always interested in hearing the latest gossip.  For her, good information is as good as gold (literally).  Rieta will often trade her wares for gossip, but chances are, if you've heard it, she already knows it.

Rieta lives simply.  She has a small room in a boarding house just a few blocks away.  At night, her pet snake, Honey, sleeps in his cage in the shop.

### Honey

Honey is *not* a familiar.  He has, however, been hand-raised by Rieta since he was a hatchling and is perfectly content to drape about her shoulders while she works.  If he sees Rieta being attacked or threatened, he will attack to defend her.  Honey is quite large and reportedly poisonous.

## Downtime Activities

### Carousing

Rieta is a good person from whom to obtain current information on the various goings on in Haven.  How exactly she is able to stay so well-informed is a matter of intense speculation.
