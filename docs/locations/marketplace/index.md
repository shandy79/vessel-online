As one might expect, the Marketplace is a bustling area replete with a wide variety of goods for sale from a peculiar collection of vendors.  Given that Haven has not been in existence for terribly long and that, in most cases, little in the way of merchandise accompanied most "immigrants" upon arrival, selection may be sparse relative to larger bazaars such as [The Wide](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Baldur's_Gate/The_Wide) of Baldur's Gate.

## Vendors

### Coppers To Crowns

If you're looking for a [trinket](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/equipment#SampleTrinkets) and don't have anything specific in mind, Coppers To Crowns is a good bet.  It's run by Snabla Huffenpuff, a doddering kobold decked out in a jaunty, feathered hat, with bushy, white barbels and large spectacles.  He uses an earhorn to improved his diminished hearing, though it doesn't seem to help much.  After setting aside his corn cob pipe, Snabla is happy to help you sort through his various treasures to find just the right item.  Prices range from 2-20cp.

### Amberdune Books

So far, all you know is that this stall 1) sells interesting and potentially expensive books, 2) is new in town, 3) is not licensed (?!), and 4) may be selling monsters.  You've seen three people working there so far:  Ramah, runner of auctions, apparent bon vivant; Inbar, a bookish fellow wearing a tidy vest and spectacles, also Ramah's brother; and ????, an older fellow who tends to the books as one would tend to a garden, humming quietly while he works.  All three have dusky brown skin and blue eyes, with brown hair of various shades.  They seem well-dressed, though their clothes show some wear.
