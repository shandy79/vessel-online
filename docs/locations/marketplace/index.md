As one might expect, the Marketplace is a bustling area replete with a wide variety of goods for sale from a peculiar collection of vendors.  Given that Haven has not been in existence for terribly long and that, in most cases, little in the way of merchandise accompanied most "immigrants" upon arrival, selection may be sparse relative to larger bazaars such as [The Wide](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Baldur's_Gate/The_Wide) of Baldur's Gate.

## Vendors

### Coppers To Crowns

If you're looking for a [trinket](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/equipment#SampleTrinkets) and don't have anything specific in mind, Coppers To Crowns is a good bet.  It's run by Snabla Huffenpuff, a doddering kobold decked out in a jaunty, feathered hat, with bushy, white barbels and large spectacles.  He uses an earhorn to improved his diminished hearing, though it doesn't seem to help much.  After setting aside his corn cob pipe, Snabla is happy to help you sort through his various treasures to find just the right item.  Prices range from 2-20cp.

### Amberdune Books

What you have discovered is that this stall 1) sells interesting and potentially expensive books, 2) is new in town, 3) is recently licensed (thank the gods!), and 4) was for a short time selling monsters.  You've seen three people working there so far:  Ramah, runner of auctions, apparent bon vivant; Inbar, a bookish fellow wearing a tidy vest and spectacles, also Ramah's brother; and Zan, an older fellow who tends to the books as one would tend to a garden, humming quietly while he works.  All three have dusky brown skin and blue eyes, with brown hair of various shades.  They seem well-dressed, though their clothes show some wear.

You've met the rest of the so-called [Amberdune Pack](../outer/index#the-amberdune-pack) at their odd home in the Outer City.  The leader of this operation is Korvala, who has done her explaining of the monstrous books to our heroes and then to [Cassandra](../scholars/cassandras_magic).  The tempestuous wizard negotiated a deal that will bring them back in the good graces of the town.

## People

### Lady Dre

Lady Dre, a settler from Godbreath, is a broad-shouldered woman and hard to miss with her usual multicolored dress and stylish hat.  She has a knack for knowing what's going on in Haven's business scene.  With her agricultural background in Godsbreath, she's put together a thriving trade operation among the farmers in [The Ribbon](../beyond/index#the-ribbon) and [The Rattle](../beyond/index#the-rattle).  Lady Dre manages to close deals with her personable nature and storytelling skills, but don't mistake her friendliness for a lack of focus on the bottom line.

Lady Dre recently accompanied our heroes into The Rattle to investigate the possessed farmers that disrupted the inaugural Awakening Festival.  Read more about this remarkable adventure in [this report](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/haven---kag-edition-agbadza79/a/written-in-blood-plot).

## Events

### Awakening Festival

One of the first groups of people to appear since the [Tearing of Haven](../../general/history_of_haven#the-tearing-of-haven) in 1495 DR were pulled from a land known as Godsbreath.  These people are primarily farmers, but also brought from their culture an ethos of community, collaboration, and celebration through song.  In particular, they've proudly revived in Haven their Awakening Festival, celebrated annually in their home city of Promise.  During this festival, the history of the land is explored and shared throughout the streets, with music everywhere ringing out the *Awakening Song*.

Two Proclaimers of the Covenant, clerics in their homeland, have been collaborating with local bards, artists, and clergy for the last year, building a new *Awakening Song* for Haven.  Since the history of Haven is quite short, this song weaves together stories from the various immigrant cultures that exist in the city.
