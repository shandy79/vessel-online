From the outside, this shop appears to be a simple, multi-coloured, burlap tent, with a 15'x20' footprint and standing 12' high.  It has a flat top, typical of the tents seen in almost any marketplace.  There is a simple banner over the slit entrance in the front of the tent that blandly declares, "Myk's Magic Shoppe".  The size of the area inside is the subject of heated debate amongst the locals.  The interior is broken up by burlap dividers hanging from the ceiling.  Rugs of various sizes and colours are thrown over the bare ground.  There are comfortable chairs and sofas scattered about, sometimes in groups, along with freestanding bookcases and an open, circular fireplace.  Display cases show off potions, scrolls, common and uncommon magic items.  Magic weapons and armour can go fast, so it's best to let Myk know what youâ€™re looking for and he'll keep an eye out for it.  He also has the "Sword of Invincibility" in a display case (though he will probably never part with it), protected by powerful magicks.  Occasionally, he has rare items for sale as well.  Prices at the Magic Shoppe are a little over the average (approximately 10%).  Myk has an ever-changing number of apprentices who help out in the shop.  There are areas off limits to the public that are roped off and marked with signs reading, "Authorized Personnel Only".  The layout of the Magic Shoppe seems to be fluid from day to day, but almost never changes during regular business hours.  It is believed by some that the Magic Shoppe is sentient.  Myk is rarely seen outside the Magic Shoppe and under no circumstances ever leaves the settlement.

## Proprietor

### Mykazhin Longreen

Mykazhin Longreen, or Myk for short, is very intelligent, wise, and powerful.  Along with Cassandra and Drusilla, he is one of the most respected mages in all of Haven.  Myk is willing to give advice when it's asked for and people rarely regret taking it.  While not officially part of the Exploration House, they keep each other in the loop.  Myk is a human, but speaks Elvish, Dwarvish, Draconic, Sylvan, Celestial, Infernal, and Undercommon, in addition to Common.

### Chormongondr

Chormongondr, Myk's familiar, is a gold pseudodragon.  The tiny fellow earnestly believes that he is much larger than he actually is and reacts favorably to those who use his full name.

## Downtime Activities

### Carousing

Myk's Magic Shoppe is a good place to obtain current information on the more unusual goings on in Haven.  Between Myk and the sort of folks that are interested in magic items, there are plenty of sources of useful intel.

### Buying Magic Items

Myk's Magic Shoppe is stocked with consumables as detailed above, but will also have a random collection of magic items available for purchase.  Most frequently, these range from Common to Rare, but Myk has a knack for tracking down hard to find purchases.  Currently, Myk is known to have at least one of the following in stock:

* [Potion of Heroism](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4709-potion-of-heroism)
* [Potion of Clairvoyance](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4701-potion-of-clairvoyance)
* [Bag of Holding](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4581-bag-of-holding)
* [Necklace of Fireballs](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4683-necklace-of-fireballs)

### Selling Magic Items

Think you have something of value?  Let Myk be the judge of that.  He's always on the lookout for new goods to add to his collection or offer to his customers, but he knows the true value of most items and can drive a hard bargain.
