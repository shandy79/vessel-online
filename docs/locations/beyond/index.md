While Haven is a bustling, burgeoning town, quickly outgrowing its walls, it occupies but a small portion of the demiplane's full span.  Not to mention that certain brave adventurers have already found accessible pocket dimensions to explore as well!

## Locations

### Mount Holbart

If you've [read your history](../../general/history_of_haven#the-tearing-of-haven), you already know that Hendor Holbart created a lot of problems for Haven when the wizarding tower he built atop a mountain detonated, leaving a massive crater that became a lake.  That mountain is now known as Mt. Holbart, a prime fishing destination and the subject of many superstitious tales.  It lies three days south of Haven with access via a crude road that winds its way into the forest surrounding the mountain, becoming a loosely maintained trail.  There are folks that know there way around the slopes of the mountain and where to access the best fishing spots from the crater's rim, but you'll have to inquire with the [Exploration House](../officials/exploration_house) to find out more.

### Fistandia's Magnificent Mansion

Not exactly part of Haven, but at least it's now reliably accessible.  Well, if you have a particular book, *The Joy of Extradimensional Spaces* (we're looking at you, [Drusilla](../scholars/drusillas_forest)) and know what the super secret code word is (cough it up, [Cassandra](../scholars/cassandras_magic)).  Oh, and you most definitely want to know what the other super secret code word is, the one that gets you out.  Be warned, the most recent egress from the mansion was on the upper slopes of the aforementioned Mt. Holbart.

If you manage to get inside, you'll find a peculiar cast of characters, some friendly and others less so.  Mostly, however, you'll gain access to Fistandia's incredible collection of books, which span all manner of subjects, and her laboratories.  There is plenty of knowledge to be gained and likely some secrets left to uncover!  Read more about it in our brave adventurers' [extensive report](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/haven---kag-edition-agbadza79/a/the-joy-of-extradimensional-spaces-plot).

### The Ribbon

The name given to a band of farmland to the north and east of Haven.  It is so called due to the dark red tinge of the soil that makes it stand out from the surrounding grasslands.  For reasons yet to be determined, the Ribbon's agricultural productivity has been declining ever since the Tearing.  This is a source of distress in Haven, for everyone from the farmers to the Mayor.

### The Rattle

Beyond the Ribbon, lies the Rattle.  This swath of land starts roughly twelve miles northeast of Haven, or half a day's travel.  It's important to note that the Rattle is ~supposedly~ definitely infested by monstrous predators, including ravenous [bulettes](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16818-bulette), colloquially known as land sharks.  Most folks in town don't like to talk about such things.  Despite this, reduced crop yields in the Ribbon combined with a growing population have pushed farmers into this dangerous territory, where the soil remains fertile.  The intrepid people from Godsbreath are those most likely to be found living and working in this area.

#### Cradlelace Lake

Once home to a thriving farm out in the Rattle.  It was isolated, but home to a happy family.  It survived the Tearing, but a couple of months after, a terrible storm and minor earthquake created a flooded sinkhole into which the manor house sunk.  This tragedy resulted in the loss of the entire family and the place has been considered cursed ever since.

### The Reek

Beyond even the Rattle lies the Reek.  As far as anyone in town is willing to acknowledge, this stretch of fetid marshland stretches interminably to the east.  Its soggy terrain is populated with all manner of nasty creatures, though there are rumours that the [Exploration House](../officials/exploration_house) has guides with some knowledge of trails into the Reek.  Maps of this area are not available in town and travel to the Reek is discouraged in the strongest possible terms.

Our heroes have recently heard reports from Uncle Polder and other farmers in the Rattle that the [Mayor](../officials/town_hall#mayor-horatio-thorndown), [Lt. Lotham](../officials/guardhouse#lieutenant-lotham-anaxapurna), members of the Exploration House, and a cadre of engineers had ventured out into the Reek.

## Residents

### Uncle Polder

Uncle Polder, a settler from Godsbreath, is in charge of one of the pacts farming the Rattle.  He's an older gentleman who prefers to amble about with a smile on his face, being a good neighbour to those in need.  However, Uncle Polder can move when he needs to, as was demonstrated in the party's first encounter with this fellow when he was fleeing three dire coyotes alongside Broxi and Jahla.

He's looked to by the other farmers in the Rattle for his agricultural knowledge and hard-earned wisdom.  Having lost a friend to a bulette attack, Uncle Polder has vowed that everyone's life is worth saving.
