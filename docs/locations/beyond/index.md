While Haven is a bustling, burgeoning town, quickly outgrowing its walls, it occupies but a small portion of the demiplane's full span.  Not to mention that certain brave adventurers have already found accessible pocket dimensions to explore as well!

## Locations

### Mount Holbart

If you've [read your history](../../general/history_of_haven#the-tearing-of-haven), you already know that Hendor Holbart created a lot of problems for Haven when the wizarding tower he built atop a mountain detonated, leaving a massive crater that became a lake.  That mountain is now known as Mt. Holbart, a prime fishing destination and the subject of many superstitious tales.  It lies three days south of Haven with access via a crude road that winds its way into the forest surrounding the mountain, becoming a loosely maintained trail.  There are folks that know there way around the slopes of the mountain and where to access the best fishing spots from the crater's rim, but you'll have to inquire with the [Exploration House](../officials/exploration_house) to find out more.

### Fistandia's Magnificent Mansion

Not exactly part of Haven, but at least it's now reliably accessible.  Well, if you have a particular book, *The Joy of Extradimensional Spaces* (we're looking at you, [Drusilla](../scholars/drusillas_forest)) and know what the super secret code word is (cough it up, [Cassandra](../scholars/cassandras_magic)).  Oh, and you most definitely want to know what the other super secret code word is, the one that gets you out.  Be warned, the most recent egress from the mansion was on the upper slopes of the aforementioned Mt. Holbart.

If you manage to get inside, you'll find a peculiar cast of characters, some friendly and others less so.  Mostly, however, you'll gain access to Fistandia's incredible collection of books, which span all manner of subjects, and her laboratories.  There is plenty of knowledge to be gained and likely some secrets left to uncover!  Read more about it in our brave adventurers' [extensive report](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/haven---kag-edition-agbadza79/a/the-joy-of-extradimensional-spaces-plot).

### The Ribbon

The colloquial name for a band of farmland to the north and east of Haven.  So-called due to the dark red tinge of the soil that makes it stand out from the surrounding grasslands.  For reasons yet to be determined, the Ribbon's agricultural productivity has been declining ever since the Tearing.  This is a source of distress in Haven, for everyone from the farmers to the Mayor.

### The Rattle

12 miles northeast from Haven, half a day's travel.  Supposedly infested by monstrous predators.  Despite this, reduced crop yields in the Ribbon combined with a growing population have pushed farmers into this dangerous territory, where the soil remains fertile.  There have been rumours of bulette attacks, though most folks in town don't like to talk about such things.  The intrepid people from Godsbreath work this area the most.

#### Cradlelace Lake

Once home to a thriving farm out in the Rattle.  It was isolated, but home to a happy family.  It survived the Tearing, but a couple of months after, a terrible storm and minor earthquake created a flooded sinkhole into which the manor house sunk.  This tragedy resulted in the loss of the entire family and the place has been considered cursed ever since.
