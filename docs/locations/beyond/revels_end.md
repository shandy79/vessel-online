Welcome to the recently completed Revel's End, named after the [remote stockade](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Revel%27s_End) operated by the [Lords' Alliance](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Lords%27_Alliance) in the [Sword Coast](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sword_Coast) of Faerun.  Its design was similar, though only half the size.  [Mayor Thorndown](../officials/town_hall#mayor-horatio-thorndown), in consultation with the Mages' Triumvirate, commissioned the construction of it to keep the most dangerous of Haven's malcontents far away from the good people of the town.  Its construction has been a secret and, though they've tried to source as much of the construction material from the [Reek](./index#the-reek) and [Rattle](./index#the-rattle) as possible, it's been a further drain on the limited building materials available to the town.

Recent missions by the [Exploration House](../officials/exploration_house) were tasked with finding a suitably remote and dangerous enough setting to make escape a tricky proposition.  Through these missions and the involvement of the Mages' Triumvirate, the Golden Vault has been monitoring the activity and progress.  Only in the past few months has the prison been completed, populated, and brought up and running with the staff described below.

For more about the people, places, and procedures in place at Revel's End, refer to the tales of our valiant heroes' fourth adventure, a mission to obtain information from the infamous [Prisoner 13](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/haven---kag-edition-agbadza79/a/prisoner-13-plot).

## Leadership

### Warden Marta Marthannis

Calm, unflappable, erudite ... allergic to two-headed crocodile?  No, she was poisoned, mildly.  Anyway, the Warden is a human mage and runs a tight ship in Revel's End.  She claims to have served in a similar position prior to her arrival in Haven, but what and where that might have been is anyone's guess.  The Warden seems to have good instincts about the staff and prisoners and is devoted to keeping the worst of them off the streets of Haven.

#### Vlax Brawnanvil

The good Warden has a guest of sorts, though this is known only to the [Judicial Council](../officials/town_hall#judicial-council) and the Guards at Revel's End.  She is possessed by the spirit of a dead companion, the shield dwarf warrior named Vlax Brawnanvil.  The Warden has knowledge of how to commit Vlax's spirit to rest, but no longer has the means to do so after being whisked away to Haven.  Given their situation, the Warden is gracious enough to allow Vlax to assume control of her body for an hour or two a day.  Coming into and out of this transition, there is a brief window of time where the two can communicate, but outside of those periods, only the entity in control is aware of what is happening.  Vlax will only speak in Dwarvish and enjoys a good whiskey and walk along the riverbanks.  Notably, Vlax has confessed he is afraid of Prisoner 13.  The Warden does not allow this "partnership" to interfere with her official duties, or at least has not done so yet.

### Head Guard Yula Dargeria

Little is known of this stern woman, other than that she is a "no-nonsense stickler for the prison's rules."  As you can imagine, she was none too pleased with the recent Courtyard riot, as it was clearly the result of a breakdown in procedure.  Her guardsmen will be drilled repeatedly to ensure no further lapses occur.  No one seems to know where she came from or anything of her background, and most are too afraid to ask.

### Head Chef Tiny Toulaine

One might surmise that "Tiny" is a nickname, but one would be wrong.  For whatever reason, this cheerful, lunchbox-shaped man was given the name at his birth, then quickly outgrew it.  Fortunately, he enjoys preparing food as much as he does consuming it, and a career in the culinary arts was always in his future.  In Haven, decent jobs at the various pubs were not available, so he answered an odd advertisement on the [Bulletin Board](http://vesselonline.org/cgi-bin/pphost_bb.cgi) and has been serving up healthy, hearty meals to the denizens of Revel's End ever since.  The secret ingredient ... is love!

## Guards

Reporting to Yula Dargeria are fifteen regular guards drawn from the more discreet citizens of Haven.  In addition to keeping their mouths shut about their work, guards at Revel's End must possess the ability to serve a two-month assignment at the remote prison without inconveniencing anyone too terribly, some rudimentary martial capability, and an ability to follow orders.  The latter is most important when dealing with the dangerous prisoners and difficult situations that may arise.

Guards serve in three groups of five, with two six-hour shifts on followed by one six-hour shift off.  Swing shifts are known to be detrimental to the well-being of the worker, but until such time as additional guards can be hired, this unpleasant arrangement will have to suffice.  Guards are paid handsomely, relative to the living many in Haven are able to make, and the prisoners are surprisingly docile most of the time.  This lack of malice on the part of the incarcerated is attributed to the difficulties in escaping Revel's End and the fact that there's really nowhere else to go aside from back to town, where they will simply be captured again.

Guards on the first shift patrol while prisoners are in their cells and supervise the prisoners while they are in the Mess Hall and the Courtyard.  The second shift is responsible for manning the two Gates and the three Guard Towers.

### Steve & Daniel

These two are the most senior and capable of the guards currently assigned to Revel's End, as described by the prisoner Quillion.  As such, they typically mind the Gates while on second shift.  They are attentive and difficult to deceive.

### Winken, Blinken, & Nod (mostly Winken)

A trio of dwarves and brothers at that, these guards serve on the same patrol as Steve and Daniel and mind the three Guard Towers.  Little was learned of Blinken and Nod during our heroes' brief visit, but Winken was instrumental in the first set of elaborately concocted diversions during the mission to contact Prisoner 13.  Winken handles the northeast Guard Tower overlooking the Courtyard and was convinced by Thursday to step aside from his duties to very thoroughly document his many ideas for improvements to the prison.  Unfortunately, it was also his dagger that was dropped by Thursday's stealthy Mage Hand to incite a riot.  As you can imagine, Winken's day went from inspired to crushed when he whirled into the Surveillance Hub to present his plans to the Warden and Yula, only to see his dagger sitting on the console and the pair with angry expressions on their faces.

### Mirabel & Cyril

In Mirabel we have a by the book, ambitious, human gal with a smart haircut and no time for games.  In Cyril, we have a half-elf guy who's just there for the paycheck and the chance to admire his gal in action.  He'll work hard to impress Mirabel, but astute observers such as the prisoner Quillion can tell she's just not that into him.  Rumour has it that he's thinking about proposing ... and that she's going to take a hard pass.  During our heroes' mission, Mirabel is unable to control Broxi and Thursday easily distracts Cyril with mutual admiration for Mirabel.

## Cooks

There are four cooks assigned to Chef Toulaine, split into pairs.  Their work days are divided between food prep for the three square meals a day the prisoners are served, maintaining the inventory of food stuffs, and occasionally venturing out into The Reek to attempt to gather local ingredients to spice up the menu.  For example, a couple of enterprising cooks from The Rattle recently served a spicy two-headed crocodile soup that went over well ... with most of the recipients.

### Breezy & Spliff

For someone named Breezy, this halfling woman is unusually severe.  We can likely chalk that up to the difficulties in completing her cook's duties while picking up the slack for her fellow cook, Spliff.  Left to his own devices, Spliff would spend all his time dabbling in herbalism of the enlightening variety.  Still, it's a mystery where he manages to find enough spare pipeweed to maintain a seemingly permanent high.  Breezy can't wait to get back to Haven where she can work in a more reputable and interesting kitchen, with more reliable staff.

## Prisoners

### Prisoner 13

Korda Glintstone, a dwarven monk, ne'er-do-well and refugee from Toril, escaped while in transit to Faerun's Revel's End and was pulled to Haven right in front of the eyes of the guards who were just about to apprehend her.  It didn't take long for her to gain the attention of the authorities in the young town.  While she is formidable one-on-one, without her network of agents, she lacks the ability to exert the same level of influence she had in Toril.  However, she quickly became fascinated with the work of Hendor Holbart and his efforts to connect Haven to other worlds.  Using her tattoos and skills as a monk, she infiltrated his tower.  As often had been the case for Korda, her timing was impeccable.  Holbart was in the middle of completing his greatest work to date, the creation of a new magical item based on his research on Sigil.  Unsure of what exactly the aged gnome had concocted, but wise enough to recognise the delight on his face, Korda attempted to steal this new treasure.  A struggle ensued, during which Korda inadvertently damaged some critical equipment in the laboratory.  Korda was unable to secure her quarry, but just managed to escape before the massive detonation.  Holbart presumably perished while attempting to prevent the blast.  The dwarven woman was badly injured and her usual concealments failed her while attempting to recuperate on the slopes of the obliterated mountain.

Horatio, Lotham, and Myk discovered Korda while investigating, managed to extract a truthful, but incomplete, account of what had occurred, and captured her.  She was returned to town and imprisoned indefinitely and covertly in cells constructed beneath the Guardhouse in the earliest days of the town.  After accumulating a number of other such undesirable guests, Horatio, now Mayor, secretly commissioned the construction of Haven's very own Revel's End, out in the swamps of The Reek.

With Revel's End complete and her transfer imminent, Korda was apparently in the mood to negotiate.  The Mayor and Lotham, however, were in no mood to entertain any sort of concessions to Glintstone, now known only as Prisoner 13.  Instead, she turned to the only alternative left to her:  her fellow dwarf and confessor in a pinch.  Baern Hoffenhorn heard her unlikely and desperate tale of Holbart's magical creation, something that Korda had not previously disclosed to anyone.  The priest didn't make any promises to the prisoner, but he did take the information to his colleagues in the Golden Vault.  Some investigation into Holbart's archives, what little were able to be recovered, revealed that there was a possibility that what Korda told Baern could be true.  If so, life in Haven could be changed forever.

### Other Current Prisoners

| No. | Name | Demo. | Crime | Sentence |
| --- | ---- | ----- | ----- | -------- |
| 1 | Gallia Strand | human female | smuggling contraband | 10-year |
| 3 | Barlo Rageblade | human male | reckless endangerment | 5-year |
| 5 | Quillion Sardo | halfling male | magical influence | 5-year |
| 7 | Pirouette | tiefling female | incitement of a thieves' guild | life |
| 9 | Ishar | elven female | attempted murder of the previous mayor | life |
| 11 | Grix | goblin male | arson | 10-year |

Of note, Quillion is the least threatening and most compliant of the prisoners.  He will willingly disclose information regarding the guards and other prisoners in exchange for pipeweed.  Pirouette has particularly dark aspirations, hoping to one day claim a place as an archdevil in the [Nine Hells](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Nine_Hells).  Ishar is the most patently deranged of the lot, as one might expect based on her crime.
